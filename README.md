# Game Theory

### 1 Matrix Games.
* CalculateValue - Calculates Val- and Val+ of a matrix A.
* **Solve2x2** - Solves 2x2 games, given a 2x2 matrix A.
* MinMax - Solves any zero sum game, given a matrix A.

### 2 BiMatrix Games.
* **BiMatrixGraph2x2** - Graphs & Solves (visually) a 2x2 BiMatrix Game, given two 2x2 matrices A1, A2.
* Nash - Solves any BiMatrix game, given two matrices A1, A2.

### 5 Tree Games.
* **BackInd** - performs backwards induction (see script for details).

### 6 Stochastic Games.
* **StochGam** - solves a game modeled as stochastic (see script for details).
